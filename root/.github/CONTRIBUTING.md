# Contributing

Any contribution is welcome :)

Before sending a pull request remember to follow [jQuery Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/).

1. Fork the master branch of **{%= name %}** into your own repository using the **Fork** button located at the top of this GitHub page.
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature` on your local system.
3. Make your changes on the `src` folder, never on the `dist` folder.
4. Commit your changes to your feature branch: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`.
5. Push your feature branch to the project you forked into your own repository: `git push origin my-new-feature`.
6. Submit a pull request [here]({%= repo_url %}/pulls).

You're done!
